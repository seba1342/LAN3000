Kahneman talks about the two different systems within our
brain - system one and two.

System one is controlled by our amygdala. It's our fight of
flight response to situations. Our reaction arc. If we see a
tiger we run, we don't think about it, or question it, we just
do. This is the emotional part of the brain.

System two is all about processing the event through a set of
matrices (or through your values). This runs through the pre frontal
cortex. This is the logical part of the brain.

Kahneman, like many others, also discusses the 'state of flow'.
He mentions that when both system one and two are working in
unison you will be in the zone.
