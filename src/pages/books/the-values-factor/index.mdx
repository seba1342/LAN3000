Everyone has a hierarchy of values. Not social values, such as honesty and kindness because these are subjective.
What Demartini refers to are the things we do subconsciously. Things were not taught to do, but things we just do.

These primal inclinations are determined by our DNA/genetics and life experiences.
These things give us a unique heirarchy of values. Which act as a unique fingerprint.

"Your voids create your values."
What this means is that your values are formed from what you perceive to be missing in your life.
The best doctors were often surrounded by sickness and death, and they wished to fill that void
in their life by contributing their skills to prevent these things.

Our brains are a value seeking system, which attempt fill as many voids while using as little energy as possible.
Voids can be filled up and values can change. And they do through our life.

The only reason we label people is because we project our highest values onto them.
