This book is all about understanding and seeing that
life is neutral and all events that are perceived to
be positive or negative, are just that - perceptions.

This book helps people understand how to disarm situations
which may be perceived to be overwhelmingly negative or
positive, and help people realise that it is in fact neutral.

If you're feeling stressed it's simply a feedback mechanism telling you
that you need to seek the neutral Truth of the event. It's your brain
telling you, hey, something isn't right. Let's look into this a bit
further.

The breakthrough experience is a series of questions that
helps you see these events in a neutral, more objective way.
Once you see these events more neutrally they automatically become
disolved.
