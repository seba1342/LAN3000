There is nothing but a divine order in this universe.
Everything that happens to you happens for a reason.
Demartini talks about quantum entanglement.
Which refers to Einstein's experiment where he splits a
photon into an electron and a positron.
Then, while separated, he spins the electron, which
automatically spins the positron in the other direction.
Meaning that these bits of antimatter are inexorably paired.

This holds true for every event in your life.
A negative event also creates an equally positive event
somewhere else - and vice versa. This phenomenon is hard
to be aware of while in a negative or positive situation.
But if you can objectify your perspective you'll realise
that all events in life are in fact neutral.

"The master is the one who sees both sides instantenously."
This refers to the splitting of the event. It is incongruent with nature.
It's our perception that causes the lopsided perspective.
