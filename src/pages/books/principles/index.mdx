This book is a collection of principles that
Daleo has collected over his life. It is a high level
view of principles, meaning, rather than a book that
tells you to ('do this hack to...') sparks your own
thoughts which are more applicable to your unique
situation.

One is, don't worry about looking good, worry
about achieving your goals. Your reputation will serve itself.

Another is, everything looks bigger closer up.
Step back, assess and realise that what is in front of you.
Have a wholeistic view.

In relationships with others, your principles and their principles
will determine how you interact.
People who have shared values and principles get along.
People who donâ€™t will suffer.
